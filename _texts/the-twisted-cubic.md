# Section 1

## Subsection 1.1
You can write stuff in _italics_, **bold**, or even ~~strikethrough~~.

Next paragraph should start like this. Do not indent.

The function $ \nu $ is written inline, but can also be in a block:

$$ \nu: \R\P^{1} \to \P^{3}. $$

Test of other forms: $5\times 5$, \\(5\times 5\\), and \\[5\times 5.\\]
Note: `$$ 5\times 5 $$` will enclose the math in a script tag, which is undesirable.


- O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
- Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle[^bugle] trills,

[^bugle]:
    The bugle is a small trumpet implicated in the military industrial complex.

*[function]: you know what a function is, don't you?
